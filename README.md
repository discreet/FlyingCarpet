# Flying Carpet
Ready-to-use x64 `Flying Carpet (Linux).zip`, `Flying Carpet (Mac).zip`, and `Flying Carpet (Windows).zip` in ![`/bin`](bin)!

Wireless, encrypted file transfer over automatically configured ad hoc networking. No network infrastructure required (access point, router, switch). Just two laptops (Mac, Linux, and Windows supported) with wireless chips in close range.

Don't have a flash drive? Don't have access to a wireless network or don't trust one? Need to move a file larger than 2GB between different filesystems but don't want to set up a file share? Try it out!

# Features:
+ Cross-platform: Mac, Windows, and now Linux!

+ Speeds over 120mbps (with laptops close together).

+ Does not use Bluetooth or your local network, just wireless chip to wireless chip.

+ Files encrypted in transit.

+ Large files supported (<10MB RAM usage while transferring a 4.5GB file).

+ Standalone executable, no installation required and no dependencies needed.

# Compilation instructions:

+ Install wxGo. For Windows, I recommend the tdm-gcc link from this page rather than mingw-w64: https://github.com/dontpanic92/wxGo/wiki/Installation-Guide.

+ Windows only: Compile WFD_DLL project with Visual Studio (Release, x64) and then run `makeIconSyso.bat` while in `icons/Windows` folder.

+ `go get -x github.com/spieglt/flyingcarpet`

+ Run `.\rebuild.ps1` from Powershell (for Windows), `./rebuild_mac` from Terminal (for Mac), or `./rebuild_linux` (for Linux).

# Restrictions:
+ 64-bit only. Supported Operating Systems: macOS 10.12+, Windows 10, and Linux Mint 18. Other versions may work, though I believe Windows 7 does not. I only have access to so many laptops, so if you've tried on other platforms please let me know whether it worked. 

+ Disables your wireless internet connection while in use (does not apply to Windows when receiving).

+ On Mac: May have to click Allow or enter username and password at prompt to clear Flying Carpet SSID from your preferred networks list. You may also have to right-click and select "Open" if your settings don't allow running unsigned applications. 

+ On Windows: Must run as administrator (to allow connection through firewall and clear ARP cache). Right-click "Flying Carpet.exe" and select "Run as administrator." Click "More info" and "Run anyway" if you receive a Windows SmartScreen prompt. You may also need to disable WiFi Sense.

+ I need help testing on Linux and supporting non-Debian-based distributions! Currently only confirmed to work on Mint 18.

+ After a successful transfer, Flying Carpet will attempt to rejoin you to your previous wireless networks. If there is an error midway through the process, this may fail.

# Planned features:

+ Cancel button.

+ Multifile (and possibly folder) support.

+ Maybe warn about running as administrator upon start on Windows.

+ Mac Only: Get rid of password prompt for removing Flying Carpet from preferred wireless networks list after transfer.

+ Replace `nmcli` and `netsh wlan` with proper C/C++ WiFi APIs on Linux and Windows.
